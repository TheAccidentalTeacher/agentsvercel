## 🎯 Current Priority (Phase 6 Week 7-8)

**Status**: Week 5-6 (Multi-agent analysis) COMPLETE ✅  
**Next Up**: Week 7-8 (Research memory & export)

**What's Working Now** (Phase 6 Week 1-6):
- ✅ Search across Tavily/Brave/Serper (Day 1)
- ✅ Content extraction with Mozilla Readability (Day 2)
- ✅ Semantic chunking for LLM processing (Day 2)
- ✅ ResearchAnalyzer class with 12-persona orchestration (Day 3)
- ✅ Intelligent chunk sampling to stay under 200K token limit (Day 3 bug fix)
- ✅ Scrollable output UI that displays all content (Day 3 critical fix)
- ✅ Executive synthesis + individual expert analyses
- ✅ Beautiful collapsible markdown rendering
- ✅ Respects selected personas (4 experts vs all 12)

**Recent Critical Fixes** (Dec 16 Evening):
1. **Token Overflow** (Dec 16 Afternoon):
   - Problem: 279 chunks = 217K tokens > 200K limit → all 12 analyses failed
   - Solution: Intelligent sampling of 12 representative chunks
   - Strategy: Beginning (3) + Early Middle (3) + Late Middle (3) + End (3)
   - Result: Analyses complete successfully with context preserved

2. **Scrolling Issue** (Dec 16 Evening):
   - Problem: Research output displayed but couldn't scroll to see all content
   - Root Cause: `.research-results` had `overflow:hidden`, preventing scrolling
   - Solution: Changed to `overflow-y:auto` with unified scrolling
   - Removed: Nested scrollbars from child elements (single parent scrolls all)
   - Result: Smooth scrolling with beautiful blue scrollbar, all content accessible

**Architecture** (Scrolling Hierarchy):
```
.multi-agent-results (always scrollable)
  └─ .research-results (NOW scrollable - unified master scroller)
       ├─ .research-header (fixed at top)
       ├─ .analysis-section (expands naturally)
       │    ├─ .analysis-synthesis (executive summary)
       │    └─ .analysis-list (12 expert perspectives)
       ├─ .extracted-content-section (expands naturally)
       └─ .research-results-list (search results, expands naturally)
```

**What Happens Next** (Phase 6 Week 7-8):
1. ✅ Test research query with fixed token sampling → CONFIRMED WORKING
2. ✅ Verify all 12 analyses succeed → CONFIRMED WORKING
3. ✅ Fix scrolling issue in research output → FIXED
4. ⏳ Implement research memory (save/load research sessions)
5. ⏳ Add export capabilities (PDF, Markdown, JSON)
6. ⏳ Citation tracking and source management
7. 🎯 Move to Phase 7 (YouTube/Video Intelligence)

## 📖 Context Loading Strategy for AI Conversations

### For Claude Sonnet 4.5 (200K Token Context Window)
Sonnet 4.5 has ~200K token capacity, equivalent to:
- ~150,000 words
- ~500 pages of text
- **Your entire project docs fit comfortably!**

### Tier 1: Always Load (5-10K tokens)
**Essential for every conversation:**
- This file (CONTEXT_LOADER.md) - Master index
- CURRENT_STATUS.md - Live development state
- Current phase objectives
- Last 3 interactions from session

### Tier 2: Load When Relevant (20-40K tokens)
**For feature development or planning:**
- FUTURE_CAPABILITIES_ROADMAP.md - Complete vision
- PHASE_6_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (or current phase plan)
- Technical architecture docs
- Persona definitions

### Tier 3: Reference on Demand (Remaining Capacity)
**Deep dives and historical context:**
- Biography and mission documents
- Historical phase completion summaries
- Legacy planning documents
- Full conversation history

## 🔧 Context Management Recommendations

### Automatic Context Injection (Future Enhancement)
Build a system that automatically includes context in AI calls:

```javascript
class ProjectContext {
  constructor() {
    this.core = this.loadCoreContext();        // Mission, values, current phase
    this.session = this.loadSessionContext();  // Active work this session
    this.persona = this.loadPersonaContext();  // Agent-specific knowledge
  }
  
  buildPrompt(userMessage, tier = 2) {
    let context = `[CORE CONTEXT]\n${this.core}\n\n`;
    
    if (tier >= 2) {
      context += `[TECHNICAL CONTEXT]\n${this.getTechnicalContext()}\n\n`;
    }
    
    if (tier >= 3) {
      context += `[HISTORICAL CONTEXT]\n${this.getHistoricalContext()}\n\n`;
    }
    
    context += `[USER MESSAGE]\n${userMessage}`;
    
    return context;
  }
  
  loadCoreContext() {
    return {
      identity: readFile('01-BIOGRAPHY-STORY.md'),
      mission: readFile('MISSION-STATEMENT.md'),
      currentPhase: readFile('CURRENT_STATUS.md'),
      architecture: readFile('docs/TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md')
    };
  }
}
```

### Memory Expansion Needed (Phase 11)
Enhance agent-memory.js to include:
- Project milestones and completion dates
- Architectural decisions with rationale
- Key patterns and coding conventions
- Cross-session continuity
- Decision logs (why we chose X over Y)

### "Project Brain" Concept
A persistent knowledge base that:
- Indexes all documentation with semantic search
- Tracks decisions and their rationale
- Maintains architectural principles
- Stores key conversations and insights
- Enables "tell me what we decided about X"

## 📂 File Organization for Context

### Living Documents (Update Frequently)
📝 **CURRENT_STATUS.md** - Updated daily/after each session  
📝 **PROJECT_STATUS.md** - Updated weekly  
📝 **CONTEXT_LOADER.md** - Updated when major changes occur (this file!)

### Strategic Documents (Update Per Phase)
📋 **FUTURE_CAPABILITIES_ROADMAP.md** - Update when plans change  
📋 **PHASE_X_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** - Update during active phase  
📋 **COGNITIVE_AMPLIFICATION_VISION.md** - Update when vision evolves

### Historical Documents (Archive, Don't Update)
📦 **PHASE_X_COMPLETE.md** - Completion summaries (locked after phase ends)  
📦 **MASTER-PLAN.md** - Original homeschool vision (historical reference)  
📦 **MASTER_ROADMAP.md** - Game editor roadmap (historical reference)

### Reference Documents (Rarely Change)
📚 **AGENT_COUNCIL_GUIDE.md** - Multi-agent architecture principles  
📚 **FELLOWSHIP_GUIDE.md** - Team collaboration principles  
📚 **personas/*.md** - Individual persona definitions

---

## 🎓 Best Practices for Context Continuity

### Starting Each Day
1. Review CURRENT_STATUS.md for overnight updates
2. Check this file (CONTEXT_LOADER.md) for any changes
3. Scan recent git commits for what changed
4. Load relevant phase documentation

### When Switching Tasks
1. Update CURRENT_STATUS.md with completed work
2. Note any blockers or open questions
3. Commit changes to git
4. Start new task with fresh context load

### When Onboarding New AI Assistant
1. **Start with**: CONTEXT_LOADER.md (this file)
2. **Then read**: CURRENT_STATUS.md
3. **Then review**: Current phase plan (PHASE_X_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)
4. **Optional**: Completed phase summaries for background

### When Context Gets Stale
**Signs you need to reload context:**
- AI suggests features already implemented
- AI asks questions answered in docs
- AI doesn't remember recent decisions
- AI proposes approaches we already rejected

**Solution:**
- Copy key excerpts from CURRENT_STATUS.md into conversation
- Reference specific completed phases
- Point to architectural decisions in documentation

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements (Phase 11)

### Persistent Context System
When we implement Phase 11 (Persistent Memory), we'll add:

1. **Context Auto-Loader**: Automatically inject project context into every AI call
2. **Smart Context Selection**: Only include relevant context based on task type
3. **Context Compression**: Summarize old context to fit more in window
4. **Context Versioning**: Track how project context evolves over time
5. **Context Search**: "Show me all decisions about authentication"
6. **Context Graph**: Visual map of how concepts connect

### Agent Memory Enhancement
Expand agent-memory.js to include:
- Cross-session memory (remember conversations from days/weeks ago)
- Project-level facts (stored once, accessed by all agents)
- Decision logs (why we chose X, rejected Y, with full context)
- Architecture principles (automatically enforced)
- Pattern library (recognized coding patterns)

---

## 💡 Tips for Effective Context Usage

### DO:
✅ Start every important conversation by referencing this file  
✅ Keep CURRENT_STATUS.md ruthlessly up-to-date  
✅ Use specific document references when asking questions  
✅ Link to line numbers for precision: `file.js#L123-L456`  
✅ Include relevant error messages and console output  
✅ Mention recent changes that might affect current work

### DON'T:
❌ Assume AI remembers previous unrelated conversations  
❌ Reference obsolete documents (check last updated date)  
❌ Skip context loading for "quick questions" (they compound)  
❌ Let documentation drift from reality  
❌ Forget to document major decisions

---

## 📞 Emergency Context Recovery

**If an AI conversation goes off the rails:**

1. **Stop and reset**: "Let's pause and reload context"
2. **Provide core files**: Share CONTEXT_LOADER.md + CURRENT_STATUS.md
3. **State current objective**: "We're working on X, currently at Y state"
4. **Clarify misconceptions**: "That feature is already done" or "We decided against that approach"
5. **Link to evidence**: Point to specific files/lines showing current state
6. **Resume with clarity**: "Now, continuing from [clear starting point]..."

---

## 🎯 Success Metrics for Context Management

**Good context management means:**
- AI rarely asks about things documented
- AI suggests appropriate next steps
- AI remembers recent decisions
- AI builds on existing work rather than starting over
- Conversations feel continuous, not disjointed

**Poor context management means:**
- AI suggests rebuilding working features
- AI asks same questions repeatedly
- AI proposes rejected approaches
- AI unaware of recent progress
- Conversations feel like Groundhog Day

---

**Remember**: Context is everything. The 5 minutes spent loading proper context saves hours of confused back-and-forth.

**This file is your North Star for project continuity. Reference it often.**

*Last Updated: December 16, 2025*  
*Next Review: After Phase 6 completion*

---

**Remember**: Sonnet 4.5's 200K context is HUGE. We can comfortably load:
- All mission/strategy docs (~10K tokens)
- All technical specs (~20K tokens)  
- All persona definitions (~5K tokens)
- All phase documentation (~30K tokens)
- Current conversation (~30K tokens)
- **Still have 100K+ tokens remaining!**

Don't be shy about loading context. The model can handle it!
